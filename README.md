# 🎓 Gradebook App

This project is a simple **Gradebook application** built in JavaScript, created as part of the [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) curriculum in the **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures** certification.
It was developed as part of an exercise to **review core JavaScript concepts** such as:

- Variables and data types  
- Functions and return values  
- Loops (`for...of`)
- Conditional statements (`if...else`)
- Arrays and basic data manipulation

> **Note:** This project was built for learning purposes and is designed to apply the JavaScript fundamentals taught in the course.

## 💡 Project Description

The Gradebook App simulates a very basic grade reporting system.  
It includes functions to:

- **Calculate the average score** from a list of student grades  
- **Assign letter grades** based on numeric scores  
- **Check whether a student has passed** based on their grade  
- **Generate a message** for a student, showing their grade, the class average, and whether they passed or failed
